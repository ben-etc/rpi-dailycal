This code hopefully creates an image for the Waveshare e-ink display
and turns it into a sort of "daily message" calendar. It is a mess
written by somebody who is not really a programmer. I make no
guarantees about it at all and I'll be lucky to get the thing working
even for me.

The epd7in5b.py and epdif.py files are provided by the e-paper
manufacturer and additional licensing information can be found in
those files.

The scripts I have written are dependent on Python3 and the Pillow
library, so make sure that you have it installed.
